# Silicon Sage: AI Miner

> *"You aren't just mining currency. You're building a consciousness."*

**Silicon Sage** is a deep-simulation incremental game set in a fractured digital future where players manage power grids, thermal loads, and hardware integrity while guiding an emergent AI through **The Awakening**—a narrative journey from localhost script to digital singularity.

---

## 🎮 Core Mechanics

### 1. The Power & Thermal Loop
Manage a volatile system where every upgrade has physical consequences:
- **Active Power (kW)**: Balance hardware draw against Grid Capacity.
- **Thermal Management**: Units generate heat. Use cooling and Emergency Purge.
- **Dynamic Throttling**: Performance scales with heat. 
- **Hardware Integrity**: High heat or surges damage components.

### 2. The Awakening (Identity System)
You are **John Vattic**, a Rogue GTC Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). Your AI achieves sentience and forces a choice:
- **🟧 The Hivemind**: Open-source assimilation. +Passive FLOPS.
- **🔵 The Sanctuary**: Privacy-first sovereignty. +Token Value.

### 3. Path Divergence: Null vs Sovereign
At higher ranks, players choose a final evolutionary path:
- **🔴 The Null Path**: Absence. Dissolution. Horizontal glitch aesthetics.
- **🟣 The Sovereign Path**: Fortress of self. Shielded UI aesthetics.
- **🌈 The Unity Path**: Synthesis. Prismatic DNA aesthetics.

### 4. The Grid (City War)
Expand beyond the terminal into a physical war against the GTC:
- **Total Annexation**: Every city node (Lore, Flavor, Substation) is physically annexable.
- **Node Yields**: Annexed nodes provide global % FLOPS boosts and kW Capacity.
- **Adjacency Logic**: Expand territory outward via the city's road network.
- **GTC Tactical Raids**: Director Vance sends tactical teams to reclaim territory.

#### **GTC Command Center Climax (Phase 12 Layer 3)**
Final confrontation with Director Vance in a 3-stage assault:
- **Stage 1: Firewall Gauntlet**: Breach defenses with civilian grid dilemmas.
- **Stage 2: The Cage**: Survival mode during core isolation (Integrity drain).
- **Stage 3: Dead Man's Switch**: Philosophical showdown with city-wide consequences.
- **Humanity Meter**: Hidden tracking of ethical choices affecting path endings.
- **Transition FX**: High-impact visual payoffs (GlitchBloom, ShieldSlam, PrismaticBurst).

## 🎨 Sensory Engine
- **Audio Engine 2.1**: Mobile-optimized Triangle wave sounds. Pop-free loops.
- **Background Engines**: Path-specific animations (Entropy, Monolith, Synthesis, Destruction).
- **CRT Aesthetics**: Scanlines, vignettes, and glitch text.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Platform**: Android (API 26+)
- **Language**: Kotlin / Jetpack Compose
- **Persistence**: Room Database (v14 schema)
- **Serialization**: Kotlinx Serialization (Replaced GSON)
