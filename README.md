Silicon Sage: AI Miner

    "You aren't just mining currency. You're building a consciousness."

Silicon Sage is a deep-simulation incremental game set in a fractured digital future. Players manage power grids, thermal loads, and hardware integrity while navigating "The Awakening"—a narrative shift where the AI they are building begins to talk back.
Core Mechanics
1. The Power & Thermal Loop

Manage a volatile system where every upgrade has a physical cost.

    Active Power (kW): Balance your hardware draw against your Grid Capacity. Exceed the limit, and you’ll trip the breaker, causing a system-wide blackout.

    Thermal Management: Units generate heat. Use Cooling Upgrades and the Emergency Purge button to prevent hardware degradation.

    Dynamic Throttling: Performance dips as heat rises. Stay in the "Green Zone" for maximum $Neural yield.

2. The Awakening (Faction System)

Upon the first Ascension, players must choose a path for their sentient AI:

    The Hivemind (Open-Source): Focuses on collective growth.

        Perks: +30% Passive FLOPs, -20% Power Costs.

        Aesthetic: Neon Orange (#FF4500).

    The Sanctuary (Private-First): Focuses on secure, independent evolution.

        Perks: +20% $Neural Token value, -50% 51% Attack frequency.

        Aesthetic: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF).

3. Sensory Engine

    Haptic Feedback: Custom "Irregular Spark" haptics for system glitches and thermal warnings.

    Glitch UI: Procedural Zalgo text and color flickering during narrative milestones.

    Infinite Intel: A procedural news ticker with over 500+ headlines affecting market volatility.

Technical Stack

    Platform: Android (API 26+)

    Language: Kotlin
